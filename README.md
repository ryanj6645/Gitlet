#Gitlet

Gitlet is a version-control system developed in java from scratch that mimics the major features of the popular system Git. Gitlet operates on a hierarchical class structure involving trees, commits, and blobs. I also implemented tree and file merging with merge conflicts, remote commands to allow collaboration from anywhere on the internet, and serialization of objects to optimize for space.
